This web application is a fitness log website that helps you track your workouts, meals, calories and goals!

This is a proposal for a web-based health and fitness tracker application. This web application will allow users to track their fitness goals, monitor their nutrition, and record their workouts. This application will be accessible and include features such as activity tracking, calorie counting, and meal planning. The purpose of this application is to provide users with a comprehensive tool for managing their health and fitness goals in a convenient and accessible manner.

The application will provide the following features: activity tracking, calorie counting, meal planning, goal setting, and progress tracking. It will have a login/logout feature, saving data feature, and a visual tracking feature to show how close they are to reaching their goal. This application will have a secure login and registration system to protect user data, will utilize a CSS style, PHP/MySQL database/server, JavaScript code on HTML5. CRUD will be used to set up the database.

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and intuitive health and fitness tracker web application that is accessible to all users.
